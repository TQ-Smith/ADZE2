# ADZE
Allelic Diversity Analyzer

ADZE is a program that implements the rarefaction method for analyzing allelic diversity across populations while correcting for sample size differences. Using individual multilocus genotype data on genetic polymorphisms, ADZE computes estimates of allelic richness, private allelic richness, and private allelic richness for combinations of populations.
